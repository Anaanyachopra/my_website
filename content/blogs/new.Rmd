Air Bnb is one of the most common platforms to rent different types of properties. Different factors in different cities can be used as explanatory variables for price.

```{r load-libraries, echo=FALSE}
#import of relevant libraries
library(tidyverse) # the usual stuff: dplyr, readr, and other goodies
library(lubridate) # to handle dates
library(GGally) # for correlation-scatter plot matrix
library(ggfortify) # to produce residual diagnostic plots
library(rsample) # to split dataframe in training- & testing sets
library(janitor) # clean_names()
library(broom) # use broom:augment() to get tidy table with regression output, residuals, etc
library(huxtable) # to get summary table of all models produced
library(kableExtra) # for formatting tables
library(moderndive) # for getting regression tables
library(skimr) # for skim
library(mosaic)
library(leaflet) # for interactive HTML maps

library(vroom)
library(stringr)
```

Using the glimpse function we can view airbnb data specifically for Berlin, Germany. The datatable will tell us all the categories of information available to the customers which they can then use to filter out which property is important to them.
```{r load_data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

# use cache=TRUE so you dont donwload the data everytime you knit

listings <- vroom("http://data.insideairbnb.com/germany/be/berlin/2021-09-21/data/listings.csv.gz") %>% 
       clean_names()


```
```{r glimpse, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
glimpse<-dplyr::glimpse(listings)
 
```

Once we know all the variables and the type of variables we can start our filtering process. Before we run regression on price, we should try and select some of the variables that we believe will be influential on the price of the air bnb. This can include number of rooms, type of rooms etc.

```{r stats, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

#running the favstats command on some variables of interest
accomodates<-mosaic::favstats(~accommodates,data = listings) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Accommodates") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)
accomodates

reviews<-mosaic::favstats(~review_scores_rating,data = listings) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Review Scores Rating") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)
reviews

reviewcount<-mosaic::favstats(~number_of_reviews,data = listings) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Number of Reviews") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)
reviewcount

beds<-mosaic::favstats(~beds ,data = listings) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Beds") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)
beds

#getting a feel for missing values via the skim command
skim<-(skimr::skim(listings)) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Skim Summary") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)
skim
  
```

The reason for running a regression is to understand what percentage of price can be explained by the given variables. The statistical term used to measure this is called Rsquared. Generally, the higher the R squared, the more the explanatory variables can be used to justify the price.

Before we run any statistical tests, we have to convert variables into numerical values. We also check for correlation to ensure that there is minimum error in the final R-squared value 
```{r numerics, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

#turning character variables into numeric variables
listings_new <- listings %>% 
  mutate(price = parse_number(price),        
         host_acceptance_rate = parse_number(host_acceptance_rate),
         host_response_rate = parse_number(host_response_rate))

#looking at the correlation for some of the variables 
listings_new %>% 
  select(price, accommodates, number_of_reviews,review_scores_rating,maximum_nights,minimum_nights) %>%
  ggpairs(aes(alpha = 0.2))+
  theme_bw() 
  

```
The above data shows us that the correlation between price and the number of people being accomodated is the highest. This makes sense as the larger the number of people, the larger will be the property and hence it will account for a higher price.

There is actually a slightly negative correlation between minimum_nights and accommodates. As one would expect, a higher number of accommodates is correlated with a higher price. The density plots also help us see that for example review_scores_rating is left-skewed with a large number of rentals having very high ratings. Another interesting observation is that maximum_nights has a peak at 30, which means that many rentals cannot be booked for more than 30 days. This may be due to regulatory reasons, which keeps hosts to from renting out their properties for very long periods of time. 

After getting a feel of the dataset, we can now format it and go ahead with regressions
