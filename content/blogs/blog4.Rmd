My name is Anaanya Chopra and I am from Mumbai, India. I did my undergraduate degree at St. Xavier's College in Economics and Statistics. I am currently looking to work in Investment Banking after completing the Masters in Financial Analysis program at LBS. My career in finance was kickstarted by the following internships:

-   Intern - Bimal Parekh & Co. (Chartered Accountants)

-   Intern - NV Capital Services (Private Equity Fund)

-   Intern - Talerang (Edtech Startup)

-   Business Analyst - RealPort (An online investment brokerage)

My hobbies include reading, baking and exercising. I am particularly passionate about behavioural finance and have read a number of books about this topic including 'Thinking Fast and Slow' by Daniel Kahneman and 'Predictably Irrational' by Dan Ariely. After working in the renewables industry for almost a year, my long-term goal would be to move back into that sector and makeimpa some kind of impact through my work in the financial services field.
