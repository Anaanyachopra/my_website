The follwing chunk of code uses two kinds of statistical tests - the 't-test' and the 'p-test' to prove the hypothesis that men have the upper hand in a work-environment. 

```{r, setup, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code
options(digits = 3)

# default figure size
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width=6.75, 
  fig.height=6.75,
  fig.align = "center"
)
```


```{r load-libraries, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)
library(GGally)
library(readxl)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(broom)
library(tidyquant)
library(infer)
library(openintro)
library(lubridate)
```

We download the 'omega' data file to see the relevant statistics for the gender gap between men and women

```{r load_omega_data}
omega <- read_csv(here::here("data", "omega.csv"))
glimpse(omega) # examine the data frame
```
```{r, confint_single_valiables}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
mosaic::favstats (salary ~ gender, data=omega)


# Dataframe with two rows (male-female) and having as columns gender, mean, SD, sample size, 
# the t-critical value, the standard error, the margin of error, 
# and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval
omega_summary<-omega %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarise(mean=mean(salary),
            SD=sd(salary),
            count=n(),
            t_critical=qt(p=0.975, count-1),
            SE=SD/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error=t_critical*SE,
            low_CI=mean-margin_of_error,
            high_CI=mean+margin_of_error)
omega_summary

```
By glimpsing through the above statistics, we can see that there is a significant difference in the mean salary received by women and men. While the number of responses is more or less the same for both genders, there is no overlap in the confidence intervals. 
In order to be more confident about the above assumption, we go ahead and do a hypothesis test.

For this hypothesis test, we assume that men and women receive an equal salary i.e. the null hypothesis is 0.

```{r, hypothesis_testing}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(salary~gender, data=omega)

# hypothesis testing using infer package
#generating 1000 samples and calculating the difference in means between male and female salaries
salary_in_null_world<-omega%>% 
  specify(salary ~gender)%>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps =1000, type ="permute") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means",order = c("male", "female")) 

#getting the p_value for the observed difference in mean salary 
p_value<- salary_in_null_world %>% 
  get_pvalue(obs_stat=73239.13-64542.84, direction="both")

#printing the p_value
p_value

#visualizing the distribution that was generated earlier 
salary_in_null_world%>% visualize()

```
Based on the results from the above analysis which we did using the 't-test', we can *reject* our null hypothesis and conclude that the difference in salary for males and females is not equal to 0. The value of the t-statistics is -4.09 and hence is a statistically significant value. 
The hypothesis test based on inference returns a p-value which is near 0. The p-value being so close to 0 also indicates that the difference in means is statistically significant.

If we now want to discuss the effect of experienced (executive level) males and females in the workspace, we can use the same statistical tests as mentioned above. The null hypothesis in this case will be that there is no difference in experiences.

```{r, experience_stats}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
favstats (experience ~ gender, data=omega)

# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(experience~gender, data=omega)

# hypothesis testing using infer package
#generating 1000 samples and calculating the difference in means between male and female experience
salary_in_null_world<-omega%>% 
  specify(experience ~gender)%>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps =1000, type ="permute") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means",order = c("male", "female")) 

#getting the p_value for the observed difference in mean experience
p_value<- salary_in_null_world %>% 
  get_pvalue(obs_stat=21.125-7.3846, direction="both")

#printing the p_value
p_value

#visualizing the distribution that was generated earlier 
salary_in_null_world%>% visualize()

```
The above analysis tells us that both the t-value of -4.93 as well as the minimal p-value indicate a statistically signficant response and we can reject the null hypothesis.
 
If we wish to relate the two scenarios, we could assume that men get greater salary as they have more experience than women in their respective fields. We can also view this via a scatter plot

```{r, salary_exp_scatter}

#drawing a scatterplot of experience and salary
ggplot(omega, aes(x=experience, y=salary, color=gender))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method="loess")+
  labs(title="Relationship between experience and salary",
       subtitle = "By gender",
       x="Experience in Years",
       y="Salary in USD per Year")


```

This chart shows that there is a positive relationship between salary and experience, both in males and females. Across both genders, the incremental salary increase when having more experience levels off at c. 20 years of experience. At this point, more experience does not necessarily lead to higher salaries.
