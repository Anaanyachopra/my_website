<p>My name is Anaanya Chopra and I am from Mumbai, India. I did my undergraduate degree at St. Xavier’s College in Economics and Statistics. I am currently looking to work in Investment Banking after completing the Masters in Financial Analysis program at LBS. My career in finance was kickstarted by the following internships:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Intern - Bimal Parekh &amp; Co. (Chartered Accountants)</p></li>
<li><p>Intern - NV Capital Services (Private Equity Fund)</p></li>
<li><p>Intern - Talerang (Edtech Startup)</p></li>
<li><p>Business Analyst - RealPort (An online investment brokerage)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>My hobbies include reading, baking and exercising. I am particularly passionate about behavioural finance and have read a number of books about this topic including ‘Thinking Fast and Slow’ by Daniel Kahneman and ‘Predictably Irrational’ by Dan Ariely. After working in the renewables industry for almost a year, my long-term goal would be to move back into that sector and makeimpa some kind of impact through my work in the financial services field.</p>
