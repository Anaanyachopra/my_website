#the summary tibble

#visualizing with a boxplot and distinguishing between male and female
ggplot(yrbss,aes(x=weight, y=gender))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  theme_minimal()

```

> How many observations are we missing weights from?
The summary statistics reveal that the mean data is c. 68 kg with a standard deviation of 16.9. Because the median is lower than the mean, the data is positively skewed. As one would expect, the boxplots show that males tend to weigh more than females. 





> consider the possible relationship between a high schooler’s weight and their physical activity.

       x="Physical activity (nr. of days active per week)",
       y="Weight")

#adding a new column which =TRUE whenever the activity level is >=3 
activity_data <- yrbss %>%

            percent_of_actives=count(physical_3plus==TRUE)/count(physical_3plus %in% c(TRUE,FALSE)),
            percent_of_non_actives=count(physical_3plus==FALSE)/count(physical_3plus %in% c(TRUE,FALSE)))

```
We can be 95% certain that the proportion of high schoolers that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week is between 31.08%-33.98%. 



  
> a boxplot of `physical_3plus` vs. `weight`. Is there a relationship between these two variables? What did you expect and why?

```{r, boxplot}
#population proportion calculation

#boxplots
ggplot(activity_data, aes(x=as.factor(physical_3plus), y=weight))+geom_boxplot()


#t test for physical
t.test(weight~physical_3plus,data=activity_data)




```

Counterintuitively, the plots show that the weight distribution among very active and less active people is quite similar. The very active tend to weigh slightly more than those who are less active. This was not what we expected since one commonly associates fit people with less heavy people. One explanation is that very active people may have more muscle mass, which leads to higher weight.Also, there are some very heavy (pun intended) outliers in the less active group, which hints at a very unhealthy lifestyle. 




## Confidence Interval



```{r, ci_using_formulas}

mosaic::favstats(weight ~ physical_3plus, data=activity_data)

```


## Hypothesis test with formula


```{r, t_test_using_R}
#H0: δ= 0, where δ is the difference between the mean weight of very active vs. less active people 
#Ha: δ != 0

t.test(weight ~ physical_3plus, data = activity_data)
```

H0: δ = 0, where δ is the difference between the mean weight of very active vs. less active people 
Ha: δ!= 0


Because the 95 percent confidence interval does not include 0, we can reject H0 with 95% certainty. 


## Hypothesis test with `infer`


```{r, calc_obs_difference}

#we specify which columns in the data frame are to be used in analysis
#"calculate" tells r to calculate summary statistics from outputs of "hypothesize()"
obs_diff <- activity_data %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c(TRUE,FALSE))

obs_diff
```


```{r, hypothesis_testing_using_infer_package}

null_dist <- activity_data %>%
  # specify variables
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  
  # assume independence, i.e, there is no difference
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  
  # generate 1000 reps, of type "permute"
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  
  # calculate statistic of difference, namely "diff in means"
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c(TRUE, FALSE))

null_dist

```

This code generated 1,000 artificial data sets, which all have their own difference in the mean weight of students.



visualize this null distribution with the following code:

```{r}
#visualising the generated data set
ggplot(data = null_dist, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram()

```
This histogram shows the distribution of the difference in means across all the 1,000 generated data sets.


```{r}

null_dist %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two-sided")

null_dist %>%

> What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that there is a high probablity of a difference in the mean salary between females and males, because there is no overlap in the confidence intervals. However, this is just an estimation and a hypothesis test is required to make a more confident decision.  



a hypothesis testing, assuming as a null hypothesis that the mean difference in salaries is zero, or that, on average, men and women make the same amount of money. 

```{r, hypothesis_testing}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(salary~gender, data=omega)

# hypothesis testing using infer package
#generating 1000 samples and calculating the difference in means between male and female salaries
salary_in_null_world<-omega%>% 
  specify(salary ~gender)%>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps =1000, type ="permute") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means",order = c("male", "female")) 

#getting the p_value for the observed difference in mean salary 
p_value<- salary_in_null_world %>% 
  get_pvalue(obs_stat=73239.13-64542.84, direction="both")

#printing the p_value
p_value

#visualizing the distribution that was generated earlier 
salary_in_null_world%>% visualize()

```

> What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough

Based on this analysis, there is a difference in the mean salary for males and females at Omega. The t-statistic returns a value of c. -4.09, which indicates that the observed difference in mean salary is extremely unlikely to be due to pure chance. Similarly, the hypothesis test based on inference returns a p-value of 0. While the actual p-value will be greater than 0, this shows that it is at least very close to 0 and thereby another indicator of a statistically significant difference in mean salary. 


## Relationship Experience - Gender?

```{r, experience_stats}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
favstats (experience ~ gender, data=omega)

# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(experience~gender, data=omega)

# hypothesis testing using infer package
#generating 1000 samples and calculating the difference in means between male and female experience
salary_in_null_world<-omega%>% 
  specify(experience ~gender)%>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps =1000, type ="permute") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in means",order = c("male", "female")) 

#getting the p_value for the observed difference in mean experience
p_value<- salary_in_null_world %>% 
  get_pvalue(obs_stat=21.125-7.3846, direction="both")

#printing the p_value
p_value

#visualizing the distribution that was generated earlier 
salary_in_null_world%>% visualize()

```

> Based on this evidence, can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the experience of the male and female executives? Perform similar analyses as in the previous section. Does your conclusion validate or endanger your conclusion about the difference in male and female salaries?  

Based on this evidence, there is a significant difference between the experience of the male and female executives. The t-statistic of c. -4.93 indicates that it is extremely unlikely that the observed difference in mean experience is purely by chance. Similarly, the p-value is extremely low, which also speaks in favour of a statistically significant difference. This conclusion does not endanger the earlier analysis of a statistically significant difference in the mean salary between males and females. However, it may serve as an explanation to this difference in salaries: males tend to have greater experience, which may lead to higher salaries.      


## Relationship Salary - Experience ?


```{r, salary_exp_scatter}

#drawing a scatterplot of experience and salary
ggplot(omega, aes(x=experience, y=salary, color=gender))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method="loess")+
  labs(title="Relationship between experience and salary",
       subtitle = "By gender",
       x="Experience in Years",
       y="Salary in USD per Year")


```
> Analyse the relationship between salary and experience. Draw a scatterplot to visually inspect the data

This chart shows that there is a positive relationship between salary and experience, both in males and females. Across both genders, the incremental salary increase when having more experience levels off at c. 20 years of experience. At this point, more experience does not necessarily lead to higher salaries. 


## Check correlations between the data

```{r, ggpairs}
omega %>% 
  select(gender, experience, salary) %>% #order variables they will appear in ggpairs()
  ggpairs(aes(colour=gender, alpha = 0.3))+
  theme_bw()
```

> Look at the salary vs experience scatterplot. What can you infer from this plot? Explain in a couple of sentences

From the scatterplot, we can infer that there is a positive relationship between salary and experience, both in males and females. The data is a bit skewed for females, since a significant number of females executives have 0 years of experience. Also, there are very few females with more than 20 years of experience. This makes it hard to judge whether the positive relationship also holds for these kinds of experience levels. 

The correlation coefficients for females and males indicate that experience and salary are more strongly correlated in female executives (0.812) vs. male executives (0.661). For future studies, it would therefore make sense to also consider other possible drivers of salary levels.  



# Challenge 1: Yield Curve inversion


```{r yield_curve_parable.jpg, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_parable.jpg"), error = FALSE)
```

At the end of this challenge you should produce this chart

```{r yield_curve_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_challenge.png"), error = FALSE)
```


First, we will load the yield curve data file that contains data on the yield curve since 1960-01-01

```{r download_historical_yield_curve, warning=FALSE}

yield_curve <- read_csv(here::here("data", "yield_curve.csv"))

glimpse(yield_curve)
```

Our dataframe `yield_curve` has five columns (variables):

- `date`: already a date object
- `series_id`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `value`: the actual yield on that date
- `maturity`: a short hand for the maturity of the bond
- `duration`: the duration, written out in all its glory!


## Plotting the yield curve

### Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis


```{r yield_curve_2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve2.png"), error = FALSE)

#releveling the maturity factor and filtering for 1999-2021

  mutate(maturity=fct_relevel(maturity, c("3m", "6m", "1y", "2y", "3y", "5y", "7y", "10y", "20y", "30y"))) %>% 
  mutate(year=year(date)) %>%  
  filter(year>1998)

#plotting using the "group" assignment to group by dates

  labs(title="US Yield Curve",
       y="%",

```
Because the yield curve inverted prior to crises for several times, for example in 2008, it is widely regarded as a crisis predictor. In 2021, the yield curve is characterized by very low yields across different maturities. 


### 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999

According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. Does the yield curve seem to flatten before these recessions? Can a yield curve flattening really mean a recession is coming in the US? Since 1999, when did short-term (3 months) yield more than longer term (10 years) debt?



Besides calculating the spread (10year - 3months), there are a few things we need to do to produce our final plot

1. Setup data for US recessions 
1. Superimpose recessions as the grey areas in our plot
1. Plot the spread between 30 years and 3 months as a blue/red ribbon, based on whether the spread is positive (blue) or negative(red)

First, can you produce this plot?


```{r gdp1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp1.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r}
GDP_graph <- ggplot(GDP_data_new, aes(x=year, y=value, color = indicator_name, group = indicator_name)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~country) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "GDP components over time",
       subtitle = "In constant 2010 USD",
       y = "Billion US$",
       color = "Components of GDP") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0, 2500, 5000, 7500, 10000, 12500)) +

> What is the % difference between what you calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?

The average percentage different between calculated GDP and the GDP provided for United States, India, Germany is 0.92%.

> What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries? 

Germany: The majority of the German GDP comes from household expenditures. Capital formation and government expenditure have been quite constant over the time. However, since the year 2000, net exports have been rising and household expenditures have increased.
 
India: Also in India, most of the GDP comes from the household expenditures. While government expenditure and net exports have been somewhat stable, the gross capital formation increased strongly from 2000 onwards, while the household expenditures decreased.
 
US: All four components of the GDP look quite stable for the US. Yet, over the given time frame government expenditures have decreased by around 15%, and gross capital formation and household expenditures gained greater significance.
 
Differences: For all the observed countries, the household expenditures made up for the largest part of the GDP. In the end of the period, in Germany the government expenditures and capital formation where the same while in the US and India capital formation was higher than government expenditures. Germany also has significantly positive net exports, while India and the US had negative net exports.
